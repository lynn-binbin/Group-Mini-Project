The distances selected are 3000 meters and 5000 meters respectively. The small range is from the various scenic spots along the city road, spreading out of the range of 3000 meters, shown in red; the large represents the spread of 5000 meters, shown in yellow. This module uses ArcGIS to operate and is used to evaluate the accessibility of scenic spots, that is, it can be used as a selection criterion when tourists want to visit multiple scenic spots.</span>
